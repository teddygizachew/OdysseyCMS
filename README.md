## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to allow users to share their travel experiences with others, as well as view the experiences of others. The CMS allows users to create, update, and delete their travel experiences, and leave comments on other users' experiences.

## How it works

The application uses JSONblob.com as a database to store and retrieve information. The necessary JavaScript code has been implemented for retrieving information (i.e., index/detail), adding a new entity (i.e., create), modifying an entity (i.e., edit), and deleting an entity (i.e., delete).

For each entity and for each action of the CMS, the interface (i.e., index/detail/create/edit/delete web pages) has been implemented using an HTML template. jQuery has been used for DOM manipulation and events.

1. User - This entity stores information about the user, such as their name, email address, and password.
2. Experience - This entity stores information about the travel experience, such as the destination, date, and description.

2. Detail - This page displays the details of a specific entity of that type.
